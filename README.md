# Introduction to `gets` and CLI Input

## Outline

1. User input in CLI applications. Reminder what it is and why it's important.
2. How to create an input prompt with `gets`
3. What a prompt will look like when they create one.
4. How they can interact with a prompt. (video / gif of that sequence would be sick)
5. What ruby does after a user interacts with the prompt (return value of `gets`)
6. Assigning the `gets` return value to a variable
7. Sanitizing and normalizing input with `chomp` and showing `strip`.
8. Example of doing something with that data - but make clear, once the value is in a ruby variable use it as you would any other string value, interpolate it, pass it around, comparisons, etc.
